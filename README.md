# Social Network Project

A Twitter-like social network web application built using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to post, follow others, and interact through likes.

## Features

### New Post
- Logged-in users can create and submit text-based posts.
- The “New Post” box can appear at the top of the "All Posts" page or on a separate page.

### All Posts
- The "All Posts" link displays all posts from all users, with the newest posts first.
- Each post shows the username, post content, date and time, and the number of “likes.”

### Profile Page
- Clicking a username loads the user’s profile, showing the number of followers, following count, and all posts in reverse chronological order.
- A "Follow" or "Unfollow" button allows users to toggle following other users (except themselves).

### Following Page
- The "Following" link shows posts from users that the current user follows, in reverse chronological order.
- This page is only accessible to logged-in users.

### Pagination
- Each page displays up to 10 posts, with "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigation when there are more posts.

### Edit Post
- Users can edit their own posts by clicking an “Edit” button, which replaces the post content with a textarea.
- Edits can be saved without reloading the page.
- The application prevents unauthorized users from editing others’ posts.

### Like and Unlike
- Users can like or unlike posts by clicking a button, with like counts updating in real-time without page reloads.
